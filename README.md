# SVM Classifier for feature matrices

This repository contains code for training a SVM classifier on aggregated fMRI data. The classifier uses feature matrices extracted from brain scans to predict the task performed during the scan. The goal is to identify features that are useful in classifying different tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is located in the `data` folder. It includes feature matrices for multiple individuals and sessions. Each session corresponds to a specific task, such as language processing or emotional response.
